### Hi there 👋

I'm *wzium*, but most people recognise me from my *jjay31* nickname. I'm a programming student from Poland.\
I believe that one day I can become a professional developer, but for now, I'm only a newbie.

My main language is **Python**, but I want to learn some **Java** in near future.\
Ahh.. I almost forgot about the **C** which is my primary language at the university.\
I might post some code written in **C** here if I find it being good enough.

Not to disappoint you, but I wouldn't look for any high-quality code here. I'm still a begginer. 

**Feel free to report any bugs and spot my mistakes, it will help me get better at coding!**
